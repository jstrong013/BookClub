# Books and Trees
We're a laid-back crew of book lovers who believe reading is better with sunshine, good company, and a little adventure. 
Based in beautiful Southern California, we bring the vibes—whether we’re diving into fiction or just hanging out with fellow story enthusiasts. Our members come from all over (different cities, states, and zip codes), but we unite over our love for in-person meetups in Los Angeles and beyond. 
Come for the books, stay for the laughs, and leave with new friends.  

## Meeting Format
We usually meet on a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday - whenever the group vibe aligns (a.k.a. we take a poll). Our gatherings are super casual and social: we’ll chat about the book (briefly), but mostly it’s about catching up, sharing stories, laughing a lot, and soaking in those easygoing SoCal moments.  

We keep the reading pace nice and slow—think one meetup every few months, depending on everyone’s availability. The book selection process? Fierce and dramatic… just kidding. It’s totally chill - suggest what you’re into and we’ll go from there.

Since our meetups can be a bit spread out, we recommend staying connected via the Surf, Hike, or Social channels so you don’t miss out on the fun in between.  

### Book History and Reading List  (if you can call it that)
2 Books read for a grand total. Maybe we’re more of a social crew with a reading habit on the side - and honestly, we’re cool with that.
