# 20-30 Something Book Club (disbanded)

*Update*: Due to member moves, this book club group has disbanded. The events and meetups at various locations was fun. While the group is no longer available, the memories definitely still remain.

This Book Club was founded by an awesome girl named Kelsey on July 8, 2018. The original group of individuals that participated in this book club never knew each other before meeting and only connected via an interest of socialization and reading.  
At this time (September 2018), the meetings are still organized and maintained by Kelsey. 
The book club is based out of Minneapolis, MN. 

## Meeting Formats
The group primarily meets up on Sunday afternoons between the hours of 2 and 8. For the most part, most meetings are social just to catch up on what's new in our lives and other novels that have caught our interests.
