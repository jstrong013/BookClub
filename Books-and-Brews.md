# Books and Brews
This Book Club was founded by the legendary gentleman Sam. The origination of the book club occurred in Omaha, Nebraska. The book club is now based out of Minneapolis, MN.

## Meeting Format
The group primarily meets up on Friday evenings between the hours of 7 and 9 pm. For the most part, most meetings are social just to catch up on what's new in our lives and of course some good brews.
