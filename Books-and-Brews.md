# Books and Brews
This Book Club was originally founded in Omaha, Nebraska by the legendary gentleman, Sam M. Since its inception, the club has grown and evolved, now calling Minneapolis, MN its home base. As members have relocated across the country, new chapters and similarly named groups have emerged, keeping the spirit of the original club alive in various communities.  

## Meeting Format
The Book Club typically meets on Friday evenings from 7 to 9 PM. Most gatherings are casual and social, providing a chance to catch up on life, share some laughs, and enjoy a few good brews. The reading schedule follows a simple alternating pattern: one month, members share what they’re currently reading; the next month, the group selects a book to read and discuss together - then the cycle repeats.
